# Changelog

## v0.4.4 (2026-07-10)

### Features

- `plugins/twake/calendarResources`: propagate LDAP user identity changes
  (email, first name, last name) to the Twake Calendar registered users via the
  WebAdmin API. Registered users are keyed by an internal id and
  `GET /registeredUsers` exposes no filter, so the plugin lists the registered
  users, locates the entry by email, then `PATCH /registeredUsers?id={id}` with
  the LDAP values. The sync is driven by the configured mail / first name / last
  name attributes — `--calendar-firstname-attribute` (default `givenName`) and
  `--calendar-lastname-attribute` (default `sn`) (#100)

### Bug Fixes

- `plugins/twake/james`: use the standard Apache James / Twake-Mail WebAdmin
  routes. The forwards and JMAP identities calls targeted routes that do not
  exist and silently returned 404: forwards now use
  `/address/forwards/{mail}/targets/{forward}` (was
  `/domains/{domain}/forwards/…`) and identities `/users/{mail}/identities` (was
  `/jmap/identities/{mail}`). The mailbox rename call also gains the required
  `force` query parameter and is now skipped when the new mail is empty instead
  of renaming the mailbox to a literal `null` address (#99)
- `plugins/scim`: force usernames to lowercase on SCIM user creation (#96)

## v0.4.3 (2026-07-08)

### Bug Fixes

- `plugins/twake/clouderyProvision`: skip instance creation when an instance
  already exists for the computed FQDN. The instance slug is deterministic, so
  when a user is re-imported after their LDAP entry was recreated while the
  Cloudery instance survived, the existing instance is now reused instead of
  letting Cloudery mint a numbered duplicate (`slug2`). The existence lookup
  fails open: if it errors, provisioning falls through to create as before (#94)

### Misc

- Dockerfile: add the missing `DM_CLOUDERY_INVITED_ATTRIBUTE="twakeInvited"`
  environment default, backing the invited-attribute feature introduced in
  v0.4.1

## v0.4.2 (2026-07-06)

### Bug Fixes

- `plugins/twake/clouderyProvision`: force `cn` to the `userName` when
  provisioning B2B users. The core SCIM mapping sets `cn` from
  `name.formatted`, which is not the desired value for B2B provisioning (#93)

### Misc

- `plugins/twake/clouderyProvision`: added detailed provisioning logs

## v0.4.1 (2026-06-30)

### Features

- `plugins/twake/clouderyProvision`: provisioned B2B users are now marked as
  pending invitation. On provisioning, the configurable invited attribute
  (`twakeInvited` by default, set via `cloudery_invited_attribute` /
  `DM_CLOUDERY_INVITED_ATTRIBUTE`) is written as `"TRUE"` on the user entry;
  the registration app clears it to `"FALSE"` once onboarding completes (#90)

## v0.4.0 (2026-06-19)

### Breaking Changes

- `core/twake/appAccountsApi`: the `:user` path param of the app-account
  endpoints is now resolved against the **mail** attribute (globally unique) by
  default, instead of the LDAP `uid`. `uid` is not unique across the directory,
  so the previous lookup could create/list/delete app accounts against the
  wrong same-named user (#88). Callers must now pass the principal email as
  `:user`. Set `app_accounts_user_attribute=uid`
  (`DM_APP_ACCOUNTS_USER_ATTRIBUTE=uid`) to restore the previous `:user = uid`
  contract — only safe where uid is unique directory-wide. Generated
  app-account uids are now prefixed from the (sanitized) resolved `:user`
  value: `<sanitized-mail>_c<digits>` by default, still `<uid>_c<digits>` in
  uid mode
- Authorization denials from `core/auth/authzPerBranch` now return **403** for
  every operation (read, write, move, delete); previously read and move
  denials surfaced as `500`. This aligns it with `core/auth/authzDynamic`

### Bug Fixes

- SCIM writes now honour `core/auth/authzPerBranch` (#80). `core/scim` did not
  propagate the authenticated request down to the LDAP action layer, so the
  `ldap{add,modify,delete}request` authorization hooks ran without `req.user`
  and `shouldSkipAuthorization` allowed the write unconditionally — an identity
  restricted to one branch could create or delete entries in any branch via
  SCIM. The request is now threaded through every SCIM `ldap.add/modify/delete`.
  `ldap.delete` also gained a `req` argument and `AuthzBase` now implements a
  `ldapdeleterequest` hook (it enforced no delete permission before). The
  `authzDynamic` path was unaffected (it reads its token from AsyncLocalStorage)
- `core/twake/appAccountsApi`: escape LDAP filter metacharacters in principal
  and uid lookups, reject ambiguous principal lookups with `409` instead of
  silently using the first match, and guarantee a generated app-account uid is
  unique across the whole applicative branch (prevents cross-user collisions in
  the shared branch)

## v0.3.10 (2026-06-19)

### Bug Fixes

- `core/twake/appAccountsApi`: drop the unused `core/auth/token` dependency
  (#83). It auto-loaded the token-auth plugin and registered its global
  middleware, forcing Bearer auth on the app-accounts endpoints and
  returning `401` under HMAC-only deployments. The plugin never reads
  `req.user` or the token, so the dependency enabled nothing; the endpoints
  now use the deployment's configured authentication like every other API
  plugin
- `core/twake/appAccountsConsistency`: harden the re-entrancy guard so that
  deleting a single app account no longer cascades into deleting the user's
  other app accounts and principal entry (#84). The guard compared the
  configured `applicative_account_base` as a plain string suffix, which
  false-negatived on DN-format differences (case, whitespace around
  separators, escaped commas, multi-valued RDN ordering) returned by the
  server, letting the plugin's own delete event slip through and trigger the
  delete-by-mail cascade. It now relies on new `normalizeDn` / `isDnInBranch`
  helpers in `lib/utils` for a robust RDN-by-RDN comparison (`normalizeDn`
  avoids a ReDoS-prone regex flagged by CodeQL). The previously
  load-time-skipped `appAccounts*` test suites now actually run in CI, plus a
  regression test covering the single-delete case
- `sync-app-accounts`: fix the bulk backfill CLI, which previously could
  not create any principal account and never returned control. A
  base-scoped search on a missing entry raises `noSuchObject` instead of
  returning an empty set, so it is now treated as "absent" and the missing
  principal is created. Attributes that come back as empty arrays (a
  requested-but-absent attribute) are skipped to avoid `add` errors
  (`no values for attribute type`). The script now fails fast with a clear
  message when `applicative_account_base` does not exist, drops a broken
  `unbind()` teardown call, and exits cleanly once finished (pooled LDAP
  connections were keeping the process alive after the summary)

## v0.3.9 (2026-06-18)

### Bug Fixes

- `core/twake/appAccountsConsistency`: ignore mail-change events whose DN
  originates in the applicative branch (`applicative_account_base`). Those
  entries are outputs of the plugin, never source users, so reacting to the
  plugin's own writes caused idempotent `AlreadyExists` churn and, during a
  mail change, a re-entrant deletion cascade that could drop a user's app
  accounts. This makes it safe to nest `applicative_account_base` under
  `ldap_base`

## v0.3.8 (2026-06-18)

### Improvements

- `core/twake/clouderyProvision`: provisioned users now carry their
  organization role and phone numbers. The role is read from a request
  header (`--cloudery-org-role-header`, `DM_CLOUDERY_ORG_ROLE_HEADER`,
  default `x-cloudery-org-role`), falling back to
  `--cloudery-default-org-role` (`DM_CLOUDERY_DEFAULT_ORG_ROLE`, default
  `member`), and is written back to the LDAP entry under
  `--cloudery-org-role-attribute` (`DM_CLOUDERY_ORG_ROLE_ATTRIBUTE`,
  default `twakeOrganizationRole`). Phone numbers are taken from
  `--cloudery-phones-attribute` (`DM_CLOUDERY_PHONES_ATTRIBUTE`, default
  `twakePhones`) and sent during provisioning

## v0.3.7 (2026-06-17)

### New Features

- `core/twake/cozyProvision` and `core/twake/clouderyProvision`: the
  RabbitMQ routing keys for the user-created and user-deleted events are
  now configurable via `--cozy-user-created-routing-key`
  (`DM_COZY_USER_CREATED_ROUTING_KEY`) and
  `--cozy-user-deleted-routing-key` (`DM_COZY_USER_DELETED_ROUTING_KEY`),
  defaulting to `user.created` and `domain.user.deleted`

## v0.3.6 (2026-06-17)

### New Features

- New plugin `core/twake/clouderyProvision`: hooks the SCIM lifecycle to
  provision a Cloudery instance on user create and tear it down on delete.
  It writes the returned workspace FQDN and organization id back onto the
  LDAP entry, and publishes the `user.created` and
  `domain.user.deleted` events. Provisioning is gated on workflow success,
  and the deletion event is only emitted once the instance is actually
  destroyed
- `core/scim/baseResolver`: support resolving the SCIM insertion base from
  a request header, gated to a configured root and never overriding an
  explicit per-user map entry, so one shared auth token can serve every
  organization
- New shared `rabbitmq` plugin, extracted from `cozyProvision`, so any
  plugin can publish lifecycle events on a common connection
- New `lsc-plugin`: an LSC destination plugin (Java) that routes sync
  writes through ldap-rest's HTTP API instead of binding LDAP directly, so
  they benefit from ACL, schema validation, audit, and the downstream
  provisioning hooks. Supports Bearer and HMAC-SHA256 auth and maps the
  CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/MODRDN operations onto the matching endpoints

### Build

- `rollup`: resolve external builtins and dependency subpaths

### Dependencies

- Update dependencies

## v0.3.5 (2026-05-18)

### Bug Fixes

- `core/twake/appAccountsConsistency`: rename the config key
  `ldap_operational_attributes` to `ldap_operational_attribute`, matching
  the documented CLI/env option `--ldap-operational-attribute`, so the
  configured operational-attribute list is actually applied. Also strip
  `dn` unconditionally from entries before `ldap.add`, preventing
  `LDAP add error: UndefinedTypeError: dn` failures when the operational
  attribute list is misconfigured
- `core/twake/cozyProvision`: destroy the Cozy instance on SCIM delete
  via `DELETE /instances/<domain>` on the Cozy admin API before
  publishing the `b2b` / `domain.user.deleted` event. A 404 is treated
  as success so the lifecycle stays idempotent, and the b2b event is
  emitted even when the destroy fails so peer instances still drop
  their contact cards. Avoids leftover instances silently re-attaching
  on re-import
- `core/twake/cozyProvision`: set `OIDCID` on `POST /instances` to the
  SCIM `userName`, so the OIDC callback no longer fails with
  `Invalid sub: <sub> != ""` for SCIM-provisioned users

### Build

- Docker image now uses `node:24-alpine` instead of `node:22-alpine`

### Dependencies

- Update `express-rate-limit` to 8.5.2, `fast-xml-builder` and other
  transitive deps

## v0.3.4 (2026-05-05)

### Bug Fixes

- `core/twake/cozyProvision`: a series of fixes so SCIM-provisioned
  users land on a usable Cozy instance

## v0.3.3 (2026-05-05)

### Bug Fixes

- `core/scim`: pass hook payloads as spread args to `launchHooks`
  instead of wrapping them in an array. SCIM `*done` hooks
- `core/twake/cozyProvision`: rename the user identifier in the
  `auth/user.created` message body from `sub` to `twakeId`

## v0.3.2 (2026-05-04)

### New Features

- New plugin `core/twake/cozyProvision`: hooks the SCIM lifecycle to
  provision a Cozy instance after user creation and to publish
  `auth` / `user.created` and `b2b` / `domain.user.deleted` events
  on RabbitMQ.
- New plugin `core/auth/authzPerRoute`: restricts requests by HTTP method
  and path glob based on `req.user`

### Tests

- Widen TTL margins in `cache-manager` tests to deflake CI

## v0.3.1 (2026-04-29)

### New Features

- OpenAPI generator now parses `@openapi` and `@openapi-component`
  YAML directives in route JSDoc, so plugins are self-documenting
  (summary, description, parameters, requestBody, responses, security,
  tags, reusable component schemas via `$ref`)
  - it skips routes that have no `@openapi` block and logs a
    `Skipping undocumented route` warning, so the published
    reference reflects intentionally-documented endpoints only
  - it now recognises `TwakePlugin` and `AuthzBase` descendants and
    walks `src/abstract/`, covering the James plugin and the generic
    `LdapFlat` CRUD surface (with a `{resource}` path placeholder)
- Annotate every API-exposing plugin with OpenAPI metadata: SCIM 2.0
  (Users, Groups, Bulk, Discovery), `ldapOrganizations`, `ldapGroups`,
  `ldapPasswordPolicy`, `ldapBulkImport`, `twake/appAccountsApi`,
  `twake/james`, `static`, `configApi`, `hello/helloworld`,
  `authzDynamic`, plus the abstract `LdapFlat` routes — 51 operations
  across 10 tags, backed by 30 component schemas

### Documentation

- Add `docs/plugin-development/openapi.md` guide explaining the
  generator contract and the YAML directives
- Fix broken link to `hooks.md` in README

### Bug Fixes

- Rename `core/ldap/organization` plugin source file to
  `organizations.ts` so the documented plugin name
  `core/ldap/organizations` actually loads; keep the singular path
  as a deprecated alias that emits a one-time warning at module load
  (slated for removal at the next major release)
- Word the plugin-path deprecation warning around the plugin path
  itself, not around the loading entry point (`DM_PLUGINS`)

### Security

- Harden DN handling and LDAP filter escaping in the
  `ldapOrganizations` plugin:
  - `moveOrganization` now uses `getRdn()` / `isChildOf()` instead of
    `dn.split(',')[0]` and `endsWith()`, so escaped commas,
    multi-valued RDNs and attribute-name casing differences no longer
    bypass the descendant / same-location checks
  - Replace `topOrg.replace(/^ou=[^,]+,/, '')` with `getParentDn()` in
    both call sites, going through the existing DN parser
  - `escapeLdapFilter()` the request-controlled `dn` and `objectClass`
    query parameter in `getOrganisationSubnodes`, and the path segment
    in `checkDeptPath`, closing LDAP filter injection vectors
  - Throw `NotFoundError` / `BadRequestError` / `ConflictError`
    instead of plain `Error`, so HTTP responses carry meaningful 4xx
    codes (404 / 400 / 409) instead of a generic 500
  - Stop double-wrapping caught LDAP errors that would otherwise lose
    their original status code
- `ConfigApi.getTop` now points at `/v1/ldap/organizations/top` (the
  actual GET route) instead of the collection root that only accepts
  POST

## v0.3.0 (2026-04-25)

### New Features

- Add `core/scim` plugin: SCIM 2.0 identity provisioning endpoint
  (`/scim/v2/Users` and `/scim/v2/Groups`), with per-tenant LDAP base
  resolution via `--scim-user-base-template` / `--scim-group-base-template`
- Add `core/auth/authzDynamic` plugin: bearer-token authentication and
  per-branch authorization sourced from a dedicated LDAP branch, with
  in-memory cache (TTL + optional reload endpoint), constant-time
  password verification, and `AsyncLocalStorage`-scoped ACL enforcement
  on every downstream LDAP operation

### Security

- Enforce base-DN scope in `LdapFlat` operations: full DNs must be a
  direct child of the configured base, blocking sibling-branch access
  via crafted DNs
- Reject escaped-comma DN injection in `LdapFlat.resolveDn`: the parent
  DN check now uses parsed RDN components, so payloads like
  `cn=pwn\,ou=titles,ou=…` can no longer bypass a textual suffix check
- Detect DNs by `mainAttribute=` prefix instead of looking for a comma,
  so RDN values that legally contain commas (e.g. `Smith, John`) are no
  longer misclassified as DNs
- Address CodeQL and Copilot findings on the SCIM and authzDynamic
  plugins
- Update dependencies
